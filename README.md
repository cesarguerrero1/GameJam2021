#Lights Out

This is a game I made for the GMTK 2021 Game Jam.
All code is my own, but I drew inspiration and help from youtube videos and forums as needed.
The only third-party asset I used was the music. I downloaded it from the Unity Asset Store. 

The basic premise of the game is that (2) players are controlling one character who is joined together at the hip. 
One player controls the motion (walking ,running, etc.) and the other player controls the vision. The (2) players are 
tasked with running away from a monster that is trying to apprehend them, but the entire room is pitch-black.

There are obstacles, holes in the ground, and various speed-up points so the vision must be on the lookout for all of these
things while simultaneously illuminating the path for their partner. The monster will slowly get faster so time is of the essence. 

Additionally, there are chances where the upper half of the partner may become disjoined from their bottom half which will 
neccessitate the other half running back to pickup their partner.
